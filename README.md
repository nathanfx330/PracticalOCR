PracticalOCR (for Linux)

**PracticalOCR** is a command-line toolset designed to automate the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process on PDFs. It leverages Bash scripts and standard Linux utilities to convert each page of a PDF into a searchable document and merge them into a final output file.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Automates conversion of standard PDFs into searchable PDFs
- Modular, three-script workflow: `convert`, `ocr`, and `finalize`
- Built with standard Linux command-line tools
- Designed for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
- Automatically skips already processed files on re-runs

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
- [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)
- [Enscript](https://www.gnu.org/software/enscript/)
- [pdftk-java](https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk)
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

### One-liner install for Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install imagemagick enscript ghostscript pdftk-java tesseract-ocr

üõ† Setup
1. Make scripts executable

chmod +x pdf_to_jpg.sh run_ocr.sh finalize.sh

2. Create input folder

mkdir pdfs

3. Add PDFs

Place the PDF files you want to process inside the ./pdfs directory.
üìÅ Directory Structure
Folder	Description
pdfs/	Input location ‚Äî place your source PDFs here
output/	Temporary JPG images created from each PDF page
ocr_output/	Searchable, single-page PDFs from OCR
final_merge/	Final merged, multi-page searchable PDFs

    Note: output/, ocr_output/, and final_merge/ will be created automatically if they don't exist.

üöÄ Usage

Run the following scripts in order:
Step 1: Convert PDF to Images

./pdf_to_jpg.sh

    Prompts you to choose a PDF from the pdfs/ directory

    Converts each page into JPGs saved in the output/ folder

Step 2: Perform OCR on Images

./run_ocr.sh

    Uses Tesseract to perform OCR on each image

    Creates single-page searchable PDFs in ocr_output/

Step 3: Merge Final PDF

./finalize.sh

    Merges all single-page PDFs into one document

    Saves result in the final_merge/ folder

üß© Troubleshooting

    Missing PDF error? Make sure the pdfs/ folder exists and contains at least one PDF.

    "Command not found"? Double-check the tools listed in the Requirements section are installed.

    "Permission denied"? Ensure all scripts are executable with chmod +x.
