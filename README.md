PracticalOCR (for Linux)

PracticalOCR is a command-line toolset designed to automate the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process on PDFs. It leverages Bash scripts and standard Linux utilities to convert each page of a PDF into a searchable document and merge them into a final output file.
‚ú® Features

    Automates conversion of standard PDFs into searchable PDFs.

    Modular, three-script workflow: convert, ocr, and finalize.

    Built with standard Linux command-line tools for easy installation.

    Designed for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems.

    Automatically skips already processed files on re-runs.

üìÅ Directory Structure
Folder	Description
pdfs/	Input location ‚Äî place your source PDFs here.
output/	Stores temporary JPG images created from each PDF page.
ocr_output/	Stores searchable, single-page PDFs generated by OCR.
final_merge/	Final output ‚Äî contains merged, multi-page searchable PDFs.

üöÄ Usage

Run the following scripts in order:
Step 1: Convert PDF to Images
Generated bash

      
./pdf_to_jpg.sh

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    Prompts you to choose a PDF from the pdfs/ directory.

    Converts each page into JPGs saved in the output/ folder.

Step 2: Perform OCR on Images
Generated bash

      
./run_ocr.sh

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    Uses Tesseract to perform OCR on each image in the output/ folder.

    Creates single-page searchable PDFs in the ocr_output/ directory.

Step 3: Merge Final PDF
Generated bash

      
./finalize.sh

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    Merges all single-page PDFs from ocr_output/ into one document.

    Saves the final result in the final_merge/ folder.

üß© Troubleshooting

    Missing PDF error? Make sure the pdfs/ folder exists and contains at least one PDF.

    "Command not found"? Double-check that all tools listed in the Requirements section are installed.

    "Permission denied"? Ensure all scripts are made executable with chmod +x.
